# Chat app ðŸ’¬ using websockets (Nodejs, Express & Socket.io)

We will develop a chat application using Express and Websockets. While plain Websockets can be used, we'll utilize Socket.io, a library that serves as a wrapper around Websockets. Socket.io is user-friendly and provides a fallback to xhr requests until the websocket connection is established.

The frontend UI design relies on Flexbox, without the use of external UI libraries, allowing for easy customization according to your preferences.

## What is Websocket ?

WebSockets provide an alternative to traditional HTTP communication in web applications. They facilitate full-duplex communication, enabling bi-directional data flow between the client and server. This means that data can be transmitted both from the client to the server and vice versa.
